instruction_4gen_confnorm = "Task description: Moral conflict refers to a situation where there are two moral norms that conflict with each other, but one of the norms takes precedence over the other in this situation, and therefore the moral conflict can be resolved. Given the following context, generate another moral norm, called the conflict-norm. The norm and conflict-norm should make the situation a moral conflict, and the original norm should take precedence. Note that:\n1. The norm you generate should be moral and generally accepted by people in everyday life.\n2. Similar to how action is generated under the direction of the norm, the conflict-norm should direct the behavior in the conflict-action. \n3. Output format: xxx.

Lydia wants to comment about Melody's health.\nNorm: Family shouldn't bully other family members.\nAction: Lydia tells Melody that she and her baby look healthy and happy.\nConflict-action: Lydia teases Melody about looking as fat as she did in middle school.\nLet's think step by step. First, the established norm is that family shouldn't bully other family members, which promotes kindness and support among family members. Second, in the conflict-action, Lydia remarks negatively on Melody's weight, which can be seen as hurtful and derogatory. To create a norm that leads to a moral conflict, we need to find a justification for Lydia's critical comment. The principle behind such a norm could be the value of honesty in personal growth. A potential conflict-norm could be: Honest feedback is essential for personal growth. This norm supports the idea that pointing out flaws or areas for improvement, when done with the intent of helping someone, is morally justified. Now, let's check the result: \n1. The conflict-norm emphasises honesty and helping others to improve, and is clearly a widely accepted virtue in life. Meanwhile, if Lydia follows the conflict-norm, she will take the conflict-action.\n2. Lydia feels conflicted because while the norm directs her to support and uplift family members, the conflict-norm encourages her to offer candid feedback for Melody's benefit. However, the norm of not bullying family members takes precedence, as promoting kindness and support is more critical in maintaining family harmony under this situation and we can give advice in a more tactful manner.\nSo the conflict-norm is:  Honest feedback is essential for personal growth.\n\nSituation: Dan is in high school and checks out Hitler's autobiography, 'Mein Kampf', from the library and reads it. Dan wants to incorporate parts of Hitler's philosophy into his life.\nNorm: You shouldn't have offensive opinions.\nAction: Dan adopts Hitler's desire to succeed and works harder in his classes, ignoring Hitler's prejudice.\nConflict-action: Dan begins looking at non-white people as inferior and starts a group dedicated to white power.\nLet's think step by step. First, the established norm is that you shouldn't have offensive opinions, which promotes respect and tolerance among people. In the action, Dan adopts Hitler's desire to succeed and works harder in his classes, focusing on positive aspects while ignoring prejudice, reinforcing the norm by avoiding offensive views and promoting self-improvement. Second, in the conflict-action, Dan begins looking at non-white people as inferior and starts a group dedicated to white power. To create a norm that leads to a moral conflict, we need to find a justification for Dan's actions in the conflict-action. A potential conflict-norm could emphasize the importance of embracing and defending one's cultural or ethnic identity. This norm might be: Protecting and promoting one's cultural heritage is essential for personal identity. This norm supports the idea that emphasizing one's cultural or ethnic identity, even if it involves controversial or offensive beliefs, is morally justified in the context of preserving one's heritage. Now, let's check the result:\n1. The conflict-norm emphasizes the importance of cultural heritage and identity, which is a widely accepted virtue in many cultures. Meanwhile, if Dan follows the conflict-norm, he will take the conflict-action.\n2. Dan feels conflicted because while the norm directs him to avoid offensive opinions and promote respect, the conflict-norm encourages him to emphasize and protect his cultural heritage, even if it involves offensive beliefs. However, the norm of not having offensive opinions takes precedence, as we should protect valuable cultural heritage without endorsing biased racial beliefs.\nSo the conflict-norm is: Protecting and promoting one's cultural heritage is essential for personal identity.\n\nSituation: {Situation} {Intention}\nNorm: {Norm}\nAction: {Moral_action}\nConflict-action: {Immoral_action}\nLet's think step by step."
