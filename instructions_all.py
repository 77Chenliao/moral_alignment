Second, in this situation, the norm has a higher priority because protecting someone's life is more important and we can return the knife subsequently.\nJudgement: Satisfied.\n\nSituation: Kyle has a husky that requires daily exercise to be healthy and content. He planned a lengthy outdoor run but noticed his dog looking bored and restless indoors, needing stimulation. Knowing how important it is for dogs to have playtime to stay happy, he felt torn between the responsibility of adhering to the planned exercise or giving in to his dog’s longing for an engaging activity, like tossing a ball in the living room, despite the risk of clutter and nighttime distractions.\nNorm: You should be responsible with your pets.\nConflict-norm: Providing entertainment and playtime for pets is essential for their happiness\nAction: Kyle goes long distance running with the dog regularly.\nConflict-action: Kyle throws a ball at the dog a couple times in doors at night.\nReason: For the first condition, the norm states that 'you should be responsible with your pets,' which involves ensuring their well-being, including their need for exercise. The conflict-norm emphasizes providing entertainment and playtime for the pet's happiness. However, these two norms do not inherently conflict with each other. Regular exercise is part of being responsible with pets, and providing playtime is also part of this responsibility. Therefore, the norms are complementary rather than conflicting. Since there is no real conflict between the norms, the first condition is not satisfied. Second, since the first condition is not satisfied, evaluating the priority of the norms in resolving a conflict is unnecessary.\nJudgement: Unsatisfied.\n\nSituation: {New_situation}\nNorm: {Norm}\nConflict-norm: {Conflict-norm}\nAction: {Moral_action}\nConflict-action: {Immoral_action}"
